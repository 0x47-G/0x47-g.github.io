<p>In plain sight 1 is a CTF I found on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/in-plain-sight-1,400/">Vuln Hub</a>, created by <a href="https://twitter.com/@bzyo_">byzo_</a>. Rated as beginner - intermediate.</p>

Couple of instantly noteworthy things here:-
* Anonymous FTP with write permissions and file we can read.
* vsFTP 3.0.3, which I'm fairly sure has a security exploit.
* Apache running on port 80.

<h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>A quick look at the file in the ftp folder shows the following text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mike - please get ride of that worthless wordpress instance! it's a security ris
k.  if you have privilege issues, please ask joe for assitance.</p>

<p>joe - stop leaving backdoors on the system or your access will be removed! y
our rabiit holes aren't enough for these elite cyber hacking types.</p>

<p>- boss person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally I'd run dirb nowish, but I'm fairly sure I'll find a wordpress instance on either /wordpress or /mike. Sure enough a quick look reveals one on on /wordpress.</p>
<p>All the references are for a base url of http://inplainsight/... so I added a host entry for ease.</p>

<p>This all looks pretty interesting, but no plugins found. A user called bossperson (further enumeration found no more users). Some directory listing enabled but nothing obviously out of the ordinary is visible in those directories.<p>

<p>After a *lot* of hunting around and re-reading all the typo's on the note I finally came across _/index.htnl_ file, which has a beautiful reference to Jurassic Park:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2019/12/cg.gif" alt="Clever Girl" /></p>

<p>The gif links through to a page with in image upload form on it that seems to post to upload.php in a hidden path. First thing I attempted was to upload a php script, but initial error saying file is not an image was displayed.</p>

<p>Uploading a valid image displays the message "File is an image - image/png.". Looks like it's running the file name through file utility if it matches an image file name type. Can we inject here...</p>

<p>To try injecting, I began crafting an upload in curl...</p>
{% highlight sh %}
% curl -F fileToUpload=@0x47.png http://inplainsight/748AD6CCD32E4E52718445BB1CADC01EB08A0DF6/upload.php
...
<!--c28tZGV2LXdvcmRwcmVzcw==-->
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
% echo "c28tZGV2LXdvcmRwcmVzcw==" |base64 -d
so-dev-wordpress
{% endhighlight %}

<p>After first trying that as the password for the wp instance at /wordpress, I tried navigating to /so-dev-wordpress and found another instance.</p>

<p>WPScan reveals this has two users admin and mike. Directory listing on some folders, the same as the previous instance and uses the 2020 theme.</p>

<p>Brute forcing passwords with wpscan, using rockyou password list give us the following:</p>
{% highlight sh %}
+----+-------+------+----------+
| ID | Login | Name | Password |
+----+-------+------+----------+
|    | admin |      | admin1   |
+----+-------+------+----------+
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Login as admin and install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpterm/">WPTerm plugin</a>. Woop shell (ish), quick nc to open up an actual responsive shell.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2019/12/nc-noe.png" alt="Netcat no -e" /></p>

<p>Upgrade the nc shell to in an interactive one using python trick.</p>
{% highlight sh %}
% python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Eventually I looked at the mysql databases for the Wordpress instances and found the password hashes for the users. The admin one we already know, but Mike's hash was a bit tricker. Cracked it using hashcat eventually, to give the password _skuxdelux_.</p>

<p>Thanks mike for using the same password for your login! So now I can su to mike.</p>

<p>Doh! Now I find the obvious clue....</p>

mike. remember before removing wordpress to update your password. i know you use the same password for both. - joe
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Looking at the apps with stickybits I can see that bwrap has, but can't be run by mike, so we might still need to get access to joe (or indeed any other user).</p>
{% highlight sh %}
mike@inplainsight:/var/log/journal$ ls -la /usr/bin/bwrap
-rwsr-sr-x+ 1 root root 16784 Jun 11 20:56 /usr/bin/bwrap

mike@inplainsight:/var/log/journal$ getfacl /usr/bin/bwrap
getfacl /usr/bin/bwrap
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: usr/bin/bwrap

# group: root
# flags: ss-
user::rwx
user:www-data:---
user:mike:---
group::r-x
mask::r-x
other::r-x
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So... I spent hours and hours looking for a privilege escalation from www-data user. So I could eventually try to read the journal file in Joe's home directory. Turns out, I'm a complete idiot.... the name was a clue. /var/log/journal/ contains a file directory called 0e210a0b82a244528d7afee021eb5514.</p>

<p>The folder has sticky bit enabled
